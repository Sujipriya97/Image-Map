                A more-elaborate definition would note that they are warm-blooded vertebrates more related to reptiles than to mammals 
                and that they have a four-chambered heart (as do mammals), forelimbs modified into wings 
                (a trait shared with bats), a hard-shelled egg, and keen vision, the major sense they rely on for information
